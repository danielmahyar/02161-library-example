For using Cucumber in Eclipse, you want to install the Cucumber plugin. In Eclipse, installing the Cucumber plugin is offered to you once you try to open a file with extension .feature. After the plugin is installled and Eclipse is restarted, you can select the project and then choose in the right button menu "Configure::Convert to Cucumber Project ...". This allows you later in a feature file to jump directly to the corresponding step definitions.

When you use this project as a starting point, please remember to remove those feature files that are not neded anymore and remember to rename the project in the pom.xml file.
